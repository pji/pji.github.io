DUNE: Chapter Three Thoughts
============================

And so we continue with the reading of *Dune.*


The Opening Quote
-----------------
We start this time with Irulan quoting St. Alia-of-the-Knife in
*Maud'Dib, Family Commentaries.* Alia's advice to women is that
the tension between sexuality and virginity in youth becomes a
"wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness" later in life.

Or, to summarize it crudely: St. Alia the Stabby Who Speaks with the
Voice of All her Male and Female Ancestors says, "Blessed are the teases,
for they shall inherit the Earth."

That's a bit to unpack.

Did Alia ever say that? When would she have said it, and how did Irulan
feel about Alia when she included it in *Maud'Dib, Family Commentaries?*
The most interesting interpretation so far has Irulan being some level
of unreliable. So, what could be the point of this?

The chapter seems to start with a conversation between Jessica and the
Reverend Mother. So, it could be setting up a contrast between the
the sexualized advice in the quote and the conversation that is about
to occur. At this point, a new reader isn't aware of who Alia is, so it
seems unlikely that too much is intended in having Alia say it. Though,
why not put it in Jessica's mouth instead if Alia isn't supposed to
add anything to it.


Jessica and the Reverend Mother
-------------------------------
Paul is waiting next door, but can't hear the conversation. Why have
him next door?
