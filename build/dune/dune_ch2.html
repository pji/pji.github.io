<h2>The Opening Quote<a class="headerlink" href="#the-opening-quote" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The opening quote says that the Harkonnens are the necessary opposites
to Paul. You can’t have light without darkness, so you can’t have
Muad’Dib without the Harkonnens.</p>
<p>If we continue to think of Irulan as untrustworthy, then the implication
is that the Harkonnens aren’t really that different from the Atreides.
Certainly cautious, curious Paul is very different from bratty and
bored Feyd-Rautha. Still Paul does display some of the sense of
entitlement I think we see in Feyd in Paul’s conversation with the
Reverend Mother.</p>
<p>Maybe Muad’Dib is just the Atreides version of the excesses of the
Harkonnens?</p>

<section id="sidebar-on-atreides">
<h2>Sidebar on Atreides<a class="headerlink" href="#sidebar-on-atreides" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Atreides is the term for a son of Atreus in ancient greek mythology.
The sons of Atreus are Agamemnon and Menelaus. The name Atreus seems
to mean “fearless,” which would track with the “fear is the mind-
killer” thing.</p>
<p>Revenge is a thing for the family of Atreus, as is the sacrifice
of their children and prophecy.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Agamemnon angers Artemis by killing a sacred deer.</p></li>
<li><p>Artemis demands he sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia.</p></li>
<li><p>He does so, which angers his wife Clytemnestra, and then is able
to sail for war in Troy.</p></li>
<li><p>He returns from Troy with Cassandra as his concubine.</p></li>
<li><p>Clytemnestra then kills him in revenge for Iphigenia.</p></li>
<li><p>His son, Orestes, swears revenge on his mother, Clytemnestra,
because it is the duty of a son to avenge the murder of his
father.</p></li>
<li><p>However, a son who kills his mother is abhorrent, so he’s
caught between a rock and a hard place.</p></li>
<li><p>Orestes figures out he has to kill his mother to exact vengeance,
paying for it with his own ruin.</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually he and Apollo go before Athena and get the curse on the
house of Atreus lifted because his acts were more noble than
anything his ancestors has done.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While <em>Dune</em> isn’t a direct retelling of the story of Orestes, there
are enough similarities that the name Atreides does seem like a
reference to the House of Atreus.</p>

<section id="introduction-of-the-harkonnens">
<h2>Introduction of the Harkonnens<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-of-the-harkonnens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Piter is introduced as having an “effeminate face.” His voice tenor,
musical, sweet. I presume we’re supposed to think less of him for
this. Maybe? It’s a little confusing since we just got done pointing
out that Paul probably has to be a blend of the masculine and feminine
to be the Kwisatz Haderach. But, then, being the Kwisatz Haderach is
not necessarily a good thing. And it’s not like we’re suposed to think
well of Piter in the end.</p>
<p>Vladimir has a very, very expensive globe of a very, very desolate
place.</p>
<p>Why does Piter wish to exclude Feyd-Rautha? If he truly thinks Feyd
will somehow spoil the plans, then either he or the Baron are wrong.
I don’t recall there being a plot point around what Feyd does with
the information, so it’s unlikely Feyd’s objection here really about
the risk created by giving this information to Feyd-Rautha. He’s
probably just using that concern to mask his real concern: being made
to perform in front of and show his weaknesses to Feyd-Rautha.</p>
<p>“Kanly,” a type of honor duel, is introduced here. Leto threatens to
invoke it against Baron Harkonnen. This prefigures the kanly at the
end of the book between Leto’s successor Paul and the Baron’s
successor Feyd-Rautha. The baron avoids kanly where Feyd will be the
one who issues the challenge.</p>
<p>Piter, and later Thufir Hawat, are described as “Mentat assassins.”
Like “geriatric”, this is a strange use of the term “assassin.” It’s
possible Piter kills people from time to time, he seems more like a
fixer or an executor than an assassin. Still, the word is close enough
to a description of what they both do that the strange usage is
revealing.</p>
<p>That Piter talks too much is foot stomped heavily here. This may echo
at the end, where Paul notes that Feyd-Rautha has to talk. Is this to
show Feyd’s inability to learn, and maybe to foreshadow that Piter’s
fate, death, will also be Feyd’s?</p>
<p>In narrative, Feyd is clearly here to learn why Mentats are useful and
how to control them, despite Feyd’s thoughts that he’s here to be let
in on the plan. The planning is done and everything set. If the point
was to bring Feyd into the plan, he’d have been included well before
this point.</p>
<p>The baron points to the human bodies of Mentats being their weakness.
More shades of animal/human?</p>
<p>We are told how the Atreides will fall here, including that it’s Dr.
Huey and not Jessica who betrays them. This is an interesting choice.
Herbert gives up narrative tension in order to show that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The plan is already in place before the Atreides go to Arrakis,</p></li>
<li><p>Piter and the Baron know how things are going to go,</p></li>
<li><p>The Atreides are also aware this is a trap,</p></li>
<li><p>Jessica is not the traitor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Piter isn’t the only one here who’s portrayed as deviating from 20th
century gender and sexual norms. They all are running at Disney villain
levels of camp. It’s likely leaning hard on the idea of deviance and
decadence leading to societal decline and the Fall. We’ll see if it
gets more nuanced than that.</p>

<section id="sidebar-on-prescience">
<h2>Sidebar on Prescience<a class="headerlink" href="#sidebar-on-prescience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We’ve now been told by two people that the Atreides know something
is up: Jessica and the baron. We’ll soon get confirmation from the
Reverend Mother that these events cannot be avoided. Is this the
first glimpse into the problem of prescience?</p>
<p>My understanding of future books in the series is that eventually
it’s pointed out that prescience is a problem. The more clearly
you know the future, the less ability you have to change events.
It sounds a little like you become frozen. And the eventual
salvation of humanity comes from those with the ability to be
unseen by prescience.</p>
<p><em>Dune</em> came out more than a decade after <em>The Foundation</em> and its
use of the idea of “psychohistory.” <em>Dune’s</em> prescience seems to be
an echo of psychohistory, but pitched as a problem rather than a
solution. It’s likely this is deliberate.</p>
<p>Warning humanity about the dangers of psychohistory seems a rather
quixotic quest on the part of Herbert if that’s what he’s doing.
Neither psychohistory nor prescience are likely to be real
problems any time soon. So, it’s unlikely that we’re supposed to
take prescience so literally.</p>
<p>But if prescience isn’t prescience, what is it?</p>
<p>A possibility here is that it’s a warning against setting false
limits on what you can do. Leto is walking into a trap. Everyone
knows it. Yet, he still does it because he doesn’t see another
option. If he’s wrong, if he has other options that he can’t see
because he’s too bound by the limits he’s set on himself, then
prescience may be standing in for letting society or expectations
govern your actions too much.</p>
<p>If that’s is what we are supposed to take from this, we should
see some clear evidence that Leto made the wrong choice. I
might be misremembering, but I don’t think we ever get that. We
just are told there is no way to avoid the current situation.
I’ll be keeping an eye open for it, though, in case I am
misremembering.</p>

<section id="sidebar-on-the-fall-of-rome">
<h2>Sidebar on the Fall of Rome<a class="headerlink" href="#sidebar-on-the-fall-of-rome" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I don’t buy the narrative than decadence led to the Fall of Rome. Why?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The date of the Fall of the Roman Empire in such narratives is often
given as 432, and the Roman Empire lasts for around a thousand years
after that.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t see Empires as a moral good that must be preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>Decadence is too relative and morally loaded a concept to be a useful
way to think about how governmental structures and economies change
over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, no one who points to decadence as the cause of the Fall of
Rome is doing it because they have dispassionately reviewed the facts
and come to that conclusion. No, they are angry about some aspect of
modern society, define that as decadence, and then point to the Fall
of Rome for why decadence is bad.</p>
<p>I have similar views about the glorifying of “barbarians” in Robert E.
Howard’s work.</p>
<p>The simplicity that comes after a collapse isn’t a virtue. It’s a
consequence of the administrative functions that allowed widespread
travel and trade going away.</p>
<p>How this works out in <em>Dune,</em> I don’t know. If it understand the problem
with its human/animal distinction, then I think there ba be someting
interesting here. Otherwise, I have doubts.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We come back to the question I had at the beginning: what is the
difference between the Harkonnens and Paul? Given how they are
described here, it seems the author wants us to find them repellant.
If they are similar to Paul, then perhaps we’re supposed to find Paul
repellant, too. If so, we’ve not yet been shown it.</p>
