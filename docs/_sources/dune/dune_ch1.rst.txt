DUNE: Chapter One Thoughts
==========================

And so begins the *Dune* reread.


The Opening Quote
-----------------
In the opening quote, Princess Irulan admonishes us to remember that
Muad'Dib is from Arrakis despite his birth on Caladan. I suppose it's
possible that we're supposed to take that as reliable, but:

*   If Arrakis is all that matters, the book would've started on
    Arrakis.
*   Princess Irulan isn't an uninterested party.
*   This is a religious text written by someone with Bene Gesserit,
    training, so it's almost certainly trying to manipulate the
    reader.
*   It's just more interesting if we take it as untrustworthy.

That said, we don't see much of Caladan, so Caladan isn't all that
important.

I think the best read is that Muad'Dib is neither of Caladan nor of
Arrakis. Instead he is of the test the Reverend Mother is about to
inflict upon him. He is of the Kwisatz Haderach breeding program, and
he is, as we'll find out, of Jessica's decision to have a son. Arrakis
is important, but as the stage where events unfurled rather than the
origin of Paul Mua'Dib.

Even if it's not the best read, I think it's the one I'll go with for
now.


Paul
----
The story goes from zero to, "Is he the Kwisatz Haderach?" in zero
seconds flat. There is no meaningful introduction to Paul without
that question hanging over him. Granted, what that question means isn't
explained right away, but it's there.

If, independent of *Dune,* I asked you what a "geriatric spice" was,
your answer wouldn't be, "It's a spice that helps you live longer." It
would be that it's an "old spice" or maybe a spice for older people.
Also, a "spice melange" wouldn't be a single spice. It would be several
spices mixed together. So describing the spice as "the geriatric spice,
melange" is a rather odd usage of half of those words.

The use of "geriatric" might be illuminating. The spice can be seen to
grant a certain kind of wisdom. Wisdom is often attributed to age,
and some of the wisdom comes from being able to access the memories of
your ancestors. So, it could be read as granting age to the user.

Melange, though... I don't know. Maybe it's a hint that the spice from
Arrakis isn't the only option? Maybe it points towards it having multiple
uses, or that it turns the user into a melange of their ancestors? Maybe
this will become more clear as I read.

    A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful.

We also immediately get a prescient dream from Paul, and the suggestion
he's had many.

The Imperium has a class system. "A place for every man, and for every
man a place." It has meant that Paul grew up with no friends his own age.
This faufreluches is apparently not as observed on Arrakis.

CHOAM is a company run by the Emperor, the great houses, the Bene Gesserit,
and the Spacing Guild. The name points to human advancement, but you know
how those kinds of name are. It's involved in the harvesting of the spice.

    one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone

Jessica's teachings set up a contrast between animals and humans. Being
animal is bad. Being human is good.

    ...The animal destroys and does not produce....

    all things/cells/being are impermanent... strive for flow-permanence
    within.

I tend to see that pitched as being part of Herbert's beliefs. If so, it
suggests that Jessica, and thus the Bene Gesserit teachings, should be
seen a correct to some extent. This is a little odd given how manipulative
the Bene Gesserit are. But, we'll see how this works out.

The symbol for the Atreides is a red hawk crest.

    We did not *get* Arrakis
    
    --Lady Jessica


The Reverend Mother
-------------------
The Reverend Mother complains about the secret ways of the Spacing Guild.

There is much pointing to Jessica being afraid. Is she afraid for the
life of her son? She is his mother. That would be natural. Though as
we'll soon be told: fear is the mind-killer. Are we supposed to see
Jessica as mind-dead here?

"Gestalten flicker" is a good phrase.

Already we're given the mystery of Paul's maternal grandfather. It seems
a bit odd that it's a mystery. We're supposed to get something from the
later revelation that it's Baron Harkonnen, but what? Maybe a realization
that the sides we thought were different are actually the same? That
would fit in with some things from the next chapter.

Jessica reminds Paul he is a Duke's son before the test. This seems to
be her using his understanding of the expectations of his rank to help
him get through the test. Maybe it's to remind him that the Reverend
Mother doesn't out rank him, giving him more confidence in his
interactions with her?

And so we come to the test.

What are we suposed to think about the test? It's supposed to separate
the humans from the animals. Presumably it also kills the animals. Are
we supposed to think that's OK? I can't imagine we are. We've not been
shown anything to make us think that Paul deserves death if he fails
this test. Is that because separating people into humans and animals is
wrong? Or is it because Paul isn't an animal, so there was no chance he
wouldn't pass the test.

A test that is fatal when failed is not usually the sign of a reasonable
group. And yet, the test here isn't unknown in human cultures. The pain
box resembles a rite of passage used by the Maw√© people of Brazil. Yet,
still, failure to pass the test doesn't result in the death of the child.
Granted it's possible this test won't actually result in Paul's death
if he fails, but given Jessica's fear I think it's likely he would have.

Which... that would have been an awkward situation. Presumably the Bene
Gesserit would have had some way to handle it, but a Reverend Mother
killing the heir of a Duke would have to have some sort of consequences.
That said, the potential consequences here don't seem all that relevant,
since they aren't discussed. It is enough to know death was a threat,
and he passed.

I still come back to the same question: how are we supposed to feel
about this test? Similar rites of passage exist in human societies,
most commonly associated with tribal societies. *Dune,* as I remember
it is very positive about tribal societies. Yet, this is performed by
the Bene Gesserit, so I remain uncertain. In the end, my view is going
to be:

*   Sparating people into humans and animals is bad,
*   Therefore, tests that do that are bad, independent of the whole
    potentially fatal concern.

I have the rest of the chapters of *Dune,* and potentially five more
books to figure out what *Dune* thinks about the test.

The Voice is described as a whip. It's a weapon and using it is violent.

    The gom jabbar kills only animals.

The Reverend Mother refers to Paul with "sirra", which suggest she sees
him as inferior. Or at least is giving that appearance, which at that
point is fair enough. Paul was being a bit of a dip there.

The Reverend Mother wanted him to fail, and she didn't realize this
before. Shouldn't she have known this going in? It is evidence the Bene
Gesserit are not infallible, and more of their order than Jessica are
prone to acting from emotional concerns.

    A human can override any nerve in their body.

No. There are things a human cannot override. Waterboarding induces
panic. Period. Belief otherwise is fodder for torture apologists.
Torture is OK because a person with a strong enough will can endure,
and those who can't are lesser. They are animals.

However, does the book realize this? Given the control Paul and the
Bene Gesserit have over their bodies, I would guess the answer is no,
but there are still plenty of pages for that guess to be proven wrong.

    We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.

    Hope clouds observation.

Jessica is relieved when she sees Paul. Her fear was for him. That should
be a sign of her irrationality. Given she betrayed the order for love,
it likely is.

    Everything in the room was immediate and pressing on her senses.

Like an animal.

    He understood terrible purpose. Paul felt that he had been infected
    with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose
    was.

If anyone infected him with terrible purpose at this point, it would
have to be the Bene Gesserit. That points to the program breeding for
a Kwisatz Haderach being a problem. That makes some sense if the 
book is to be seen as a warning against charismatic/messianic leaders.
Though, it's an odd angle to go for. This isn't people falling under
the sway of a charismatic leader. This is people creating a charismatic
leader under the belief they could keep that leader under their control.
The statement isn't that Paul the charismatic leader is bad. It's that
Paul is as much a victim as those who die in his jihad. It is the Bene
Gesserit who are the cause.

Charismatic leaders don't happen. They are created by people who want
those leaders to solve problems for them. That's an interesting take.
I don't think that's actually how the world works, but we'll see where
is goes.

The Bene Gesserit believe that men who turned over their thinking to
machines were enslaved by other men with machines. The Butlerian Jihad
removed a "crutch" leading to the development of Mentats, the Bene
Gesserit, and the Space Guild. This was a freeing of humanity.

The Bene Gesserit were created by those who wanted "a thread of
continuity in human affairs." The Reverend Mother goes on to explain
human stock had to be separated from animal stock for breeding, but
that seems false to Paul. Paul inuitions about that sort of thing 
are likely accurate.

In fact everything being said there about the breeding program is a
lie, but the Reverend Mother doesn't know it. So, the Bene Gesserit
were not created for the breeding program. Though the separating humans
from animals part was true. So the Bene Gesserit must be lying to
themselves or tricked into thinking it is their purpose. Their real
purpose is tied to his terrible purpose.

The Reverend Mothers are repelled, terrorized, by the masculine avenues
to the past. This isn't pitched as a lie, so it's presumably true. Men
die when given the Truthsayer's drug. Given the nearness to the reference
to women being afraid of the pasts of their male ancestors, it seems like
the female ancestors kill men. The Kwisatz Haderach, who can be many
places at once, can also be both genders at once. This is pointed to
with Paul's Bene Gesserit training and his responsibility as a Duke's
heir (and also likely his Mentat training).

Also, if the Reverend Mothers are terrorized by their masculine
ancestors, they are not fully human. This may be hinted at in
Jessica's animal tendencies. Though, they are more human than men,
who all die when confronted with their female ancestors.

Given Paul's ability to intuit truth, it's pretty clear the animal/
human distinction is supposed to be understood as real. However, the
purpose of the Bene Gesserit is not to breed humans. It's to create
Paul's jihad. They just don't realize that's the case.

But in what way is purpose truth? If the Bene Gesserit don't determine
their purpose, then who does? Paul? But if that's the case, then this
is all moot. Charismatic leaders and the horrors their existence cause
are acausal. The coming of the leader creates the conditions that lead
to their creation. That fits with later comments about prescience, but
I doubt that's where the book will land.


Character First Thoughts
------------------------

*   Paul: Wonders what gom jabbar is.
*   Reverend Mother: Curses Jessica.
*   Jessica: Her son is still alive.


Conclusion
----------
We've got the rest of the book and then five more books to go. Obviously
any conclusions here are extremely preliminary. However, here are some
things I think I've picked up:

*   Boy, we're being told a lot, but what are we being shown?
*   Are we supposed to take the human/animal distinction seriously?
*   It seems like the answer is yes, but I have great concerns if
    that holds.
*   Jessica shows animal traits, as do the Bene Gesserit.
*   Paul does not.
*   It's unclear exactly who is supposed to beware of charismatic
    leaders, but it seems like it's pointing towards it being a bad
    idea to create them with the assumption they would be under
    your control.
*   The message here may be that we are all a bit animals, and we
    shouldn't wish for a full human to rule us.
*   I'd say that has echoes in the Butlerian Jihad, but the concern
    there was still men enslaving men, not men enslaving animals.

The question now seems to be, if Paul is human, is what he does good?
Is his terrible purpose good, and if it is how is this a warning against
charismatic leaders?
