DUNE: Chapter Six Thoughts
==========================

And so we continue with the reading of *Dune.*


The Opening Quote
-----------------

    What is the son but an extension of the father?

Well, he's also fifty precent his mother, which is strongly pointed to
by how much we know about Jessica so far.

Otherwise this opening quote seems to be bringing up the question rather
than giving us something to juxtapose with the rest of the chapter. No
strong claims are made here. Nothing seems glaringly absent. It just
raises Leto as a question. Who was Paul's father?


Leto
----

    As always, Paul experienced a sense of *presence* in his father,
    someone totally *here.*

I'm not entirely certain what this is supposed to mean. It's probably
something like a focus. He doesn't seem distracted or absent. When he's
somewhere, he is there. It may also be related to charisma. He has the
ability to make everyone feel like he is interested in them, that they
are important to them. Maybe? There is also the possibility that as the
father of the Kwisatz Haderach, he is likely close to being a Kwisatz
Haderach himself. His presense in the moment may be related to that.

Leto is a war leader. He has a speech ready to go to put his mens'
minds at ease before battle. He just about gives one to his son before
realizing it would be better for him to understand the danger. This
doesn't seem like the behavior of someone who is just the titular head
of a military. Combat is relatively frequent in this setting.

Paul has been conditioned against telling his father what the Reverend
Mother told him. Why? Would it change outcomes? Leto's dismissal of the
Reverend Mother's statements suggests there would be no difference.
Unless that reaction is conditioned as well? Perhaps there are ways
for this to work out differently, but none of them lead to outcomes
that are desired by the Bene Gesserit, and so they have arranged things
so Leto must die?

    No woman wants her loved ones endangered.
    
    --Duke Leto Atreides on Jessica and the Reverend Mother

And men do? Also, we just saw Jessica allow Paul's life to be put at risk
in a test, so it's not like they are unwilling to do it. This could just
be standard misogyny but conditioning could be at play here. It's such
an offhand way to treat the warnings.

Like Baron Harkonnen and Feyd-Rautha, Leto is only bringing Paul into
the planning now. Though, Leto isn't making his Mentat dance for his
heir like the Baron did.

CHOAM is involved in the trade of all commodities. There are lots of
Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. If spice production is hit, it
hits their pocketbooks, making the Atreides very unpopular.

The Duke is the spokesman for an unofficial bloc within the Landsraad,
which is what makes him a threat to the Emperor.

There is insider trading going on, which gave away the plan to the
Atreides. Basically, when spice production takes a hit, spice prices
will increase. Houses that know of the plot are stockpiling spice in
anticipation. This is how Leto knows the Emperor is involved in the
plot.

Reaching out to the Landsraad wouldn't help, and it would tip off the
plotters that the Atreides know about the plot. But, we saw in chapter
three that the Harkonnens already know the Atreides know about the plot.
Or, at least, that they guess there is a plot. So Leto's belief the
plotters will underestimate what he knows about the plot is likely
wrong.

Leto's plan is truly ambitious. He doesn't just want to rule Arrakis.
He wants to turn the Fremen into an army that will challenge the
Sardaukar. He is looking to challenge the Imperial throne. Given the
Emperor's involvement in the plot, it's likely the Emperor saw this
coming.

Of course, Duke Leto does get his wish: Fremen fighting under the
Atreides banner. It just is under Paul, and it leeds to the Jihad.

It's apparently not widely known that the Sardaukar come from Salusa
Secondus.

Paul has been training to be a Mentat all his life without realizing
it. This is apparently a requirement of Mentat training, which... OK.
Why is that an element? I suppose it get a good reveal for the chapter,
but I'm not sure that's enough. What about Mentat training would be
affected by knowing you were receiving Mentat training as a child?
Maybe it boxes your mind in, so you start seeing those skills as
separate from your natural thought processes, making you less fluent
in Mentat thought? That's just a wild guess, though. I'll have to keep
my eyes open for an answer to that one, too.

If the question about Mentat training is a test, everyone whose met
Paul so far has come to test him in some way, except possibly Dr. Yueh.


Character First Thoughts
------------------------

*   Leto: I must rest now, for there will be no rest on Arrakis.


Conclusion
----------
The questions I have after chapter six:

*   Is the Duke's reaction to warning about Arrakis caused by some
    sort of conditioning or hubris?
*   Is there no way to save Leto, or is there just no way that the
    Bene Gesserit like?
*   Why does Mentat training have to be kept hidden from the trainee?
*   What wars has Leto been fighting?
