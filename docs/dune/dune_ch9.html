<h1>DUNE: Chapter Nine Thoughts<a class="headerlink" href="#dune-chapter-nine-thoughts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>And so we continue with the reading of <em>Dune.</em></p>
<section id="the-opening-quote">
<h2>The Opening Quote<a class="headerlink" href="#the-opening-quote" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Irulan, who has Bene Gesserit training, says Muad’Dib could learn
fast because he’d had Bene Gesserit training. Send your kids to Bene
Gesserit schools, and they can learn just as fast as Paul Muad’Dib did.</p>
<p>I don’t know this should be taken to be wrong, though. I suppose it’s
possible that he doesn’t actually learn. In fact, that is probably
correct. He doesn’t learn. He just knows what to do because he is
prescient. That wouldn’t lead families to send their kids to be
trained by the Bene Gesserit, though.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Irulan setting up the events of the chapter are a lesson</p>
</div></blockquote>

<section id="hunter-seeker">
<h2>Hunter-Seeker<a class="headerlink" href="#hunter-seeker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Paul is still immature enough to enjoy tricking people.</p>
<p>The headboard and its aquatic features were likely designed to attract
Paul. And they worked. Though, why was this bed in the house if it
hadn’t been torn apart by Thufir Hawat’s people?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Names and pictures, names and pictures from man’s terranic past—and
many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on
Arrakis.</p>
<p class="attribution">—A filmbook on the fauna of Arrakis</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I was wrong. Terranic does, indeed, mean relating to Terra/Earth. That
means Earth is a thing in the <em>Dune</em> universe, but it’s in the past.
Arrakis is one of the few places that has lifeforms like those that
arose there. I’m sure it would be well known were it possible that
Arrakis is Earth, but it’s weird to bring it up here unless it’s a
possibility.</p>
<p>Children of royal blood are taught about common assassination tools at
a young age. It’s a little amazing any of them make it to adulthood.</p>
<p>Who is operating the hunter-seeker? Yueh would seem like a likely
option, but it would seem reckless of either him or the Harkonnens to
risk burning himself at this point.</p>
<p>Laser beams and shields don’t play nicely together. This seems a way to
keep knife-fitting and physical prowess relevant. If the best option
was to sit back with a sniper rifle, it would be a much less exciting
novel.</p>
<p>Shadout Mapes discharges her debt with the knowledge there is a
traitor in their midsts. Trading a definite saving of a life for
a vague bit of information seems like an unbalanced trade. But,
then it’s probably clear to both of them that Paul isn’t interested
in pushing the matter. She’s also annoyed at receiving orders from
him, which may play a part here, too.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This mainly seems like an avenue to display Paul’s abilities and
build a connection between him and the Fremen. No real deep questions
arise here beyond:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why do Earth-like creatures appear on this world more than other
worlds?</p></li>
</ul>
