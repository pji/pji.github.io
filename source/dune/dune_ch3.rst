DUNE: Chapter Three Thoughts
============================

And so we continue with the reading of *Dune.*


The Opening Quote
-----------------
We start this time with Irulan quoting St. Alia-of-the-Knife in
*Maud'Dib, Family Commentaries.* Alia's advice to women is that
the tension between sexuality and virginity in youth becomes a
"wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness" later in life.

Or, to summarize it crudely: St. Alia the Stabby Who Speaks with the
Voice of All her Male and Female Ancestors says, "Blessed are the teases,
for they shall inherit the Earth."

That's a bit to unpack.

Did Alia ever say that? When would she have said it, and how did Irulan
feel about Alia when she included it in *Maud'Dib, Family Commentaries?*
The most interesting interpretation so far has Irulan being some level
of unreliable. So, what could be the point of this?

The chapter seems to start with a conversation between Jessica and the
Reverend Mother. So, it could be setting up a contrast between the
the sexualized advice in the quote and the conversation that is about
to occur. At this point, a new reader isn't aware of who Alia is, so it
seems unlikely that too much is intended in having Alia say it. Though,
why not put it in Jessica's mouth instead if Alia isn't supposed to
add anything to it.


Jessica and the Reverend Mother
-------------------------------
Jessica knows she's being goaded into anger, yet she still becomes
angry.

The plan was for Jessica to bear a daughter, who would then be married
to the Harkonnen heir, sealing the breach between the two houses.
Jessica sensed the possibility she could bear the Kwisatz Haderach, but
that's not why she had a son. She had a son because Leto wanted a son.
She did it for love.

I presume we're supposed to be in favor of that, and I more or less am.

    You are not infallible.
    
    --Lady Jessica to the Reverend Mother

That Jessica and Paul will be fugitives seems like it's news to Jessica.
This raises a question: How much did Jessica and the Bene Gesserit know
about the future before she decided to have a son? It seems unlikely
that, given the option between Leto surviving and Leto having a son that
Jessica would choose Leto having a son. If it were already known that the
Harkonnens would topple House Atreides and kill Leto, then Jessica may
have even stronger pressure than just his desire for a son. It could
be a gift for a love she knows will die.

    The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of its
    heredity.

I'm sure the information around CHOAM is important. I don't have a lot
to say about it, though.

    In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures.

I suspect truth in that. At least as U.S. politics goes a third party
cannot stand. If a new party crossed over into relevance, then one of
the other two parties will either join it or fail. That is a planned
feature of our system, though. Whether that is universally true, I
don't know. It does seem true, though, since two parties uniting can
freeze out the other party.

The Missionaria Protectiva have softened up Arrakis.

Jessica and the Reverend Mother have a caring relationship. The Reverend
Mother thinks of Jessica as a daughter. Or, at least that's what she says.
However, it is likely true.

    Humans are almost always lonely.

That line doesn't make a lot of sense if we aren't supposed to take the
human/animal distinction seriously.


Paul's Dream
------------
Paul dreams every night and remember every dream. He also knows which
ones are prophetic and which ones aren't.

We're introduced to Chani through Paul's dream. She's afraid, and she
asks him to tell her of his homeworld.

Paul only sees what is happening in the dream. He doesn't get context
with the dream. He doesn't know why he's excited or why Chani is afraid.
He doesn't even know that "Usul" is the name she uses for him. This
would seem to leave the future open to misinterpretation.

The poem:

*   Written by Gurney Halleck.
*   "...tone poem for sad times."
*   It's Jessica who actually says it.
*   A wind chases the seagulls away.
*   The fire scorches the seaweed.

Paul remains silent when the Reverend Mother expects him to speak. This
contrasts with Piter and, later, Feyd-Rautha. Paul is in control of
himself. He is human.

The Reverend Mother, and so likely the Bene Gesserit, don't actually
know anything about the Kwisatz Haderach. Her hints aren't helpful.
They are bringing about a messiah, but don't know what that means. To
reference other pop culture, they are Belloq opening the Ark of the
Convenant, thinking that God would do what he wants.

Though, that comes back to the question of purpose. Paul says he has a
terrible purpose. If the Bene Gesserit don't know or are wrong about
that purpose, then who is giving Paul that purpose? Is "purpose" here
maybe just a stand in for "will cause certain terrible events to
occur?"

The way Paul brings up saving his father suggests two possibilities:

*   He is the voice of truth, and saving his father avoids the jihad,
*   He isn't yet mature enough to understand his father can't be saved.

We're given a lot of reason to think the Bene Gesserit are mistaken:

*   Paul says they don't know anything about the Kwisatz Haderach,
*   Paul says they don't know the real reason for the testing,
*   They couldn't see that Jessica would have a boy,
*   They kill children who fail the test,
*   They classify people as either human or animal.

Yet, Paul doesn't feel like what she says about Leto is false. Therefore,
it's presumably accurate. If so, the book seems to say the Bene Gesserit
are correct that Leto can't be saved, so there is no message here about
the importance of saving good leaders or even a life or anything like
that. Leto's, and likely also Baron Harkonnen's, death is set. Paul
just isn't ready to see the necessity of it.

    What made her so sure?

Presumably, limited prescience made her so sure. We also just saw that
if she were wrong, you'd know that, Paul. Though, again, I'm not sure
why events get fixed in a way that allows for prescience. Maybe the
certainty around this is the problem.

The Reverend Mother's tears show she does care for Jessica, at least.
That gives some answer to the question of why Jessica was allowed to be
in a position to choose to have a son. The Bene Gesserit aren't machines.
Their personal feelings play a role in what they do. Jessica was and is
trusted because of the Reverend Mother's love for her. Paul was born
because of Jessica's love for Leto.

Is that what the opening quote was suggesting? The Bene Gesserit think
the tension between their sexuality and their virginity gives them
wisdom and power, but in he chapter we see that love will bring all
of that to nought. I think that's probably as good a read on it as
I'm likely to come up with.


Conclusion
----------
I think I leave chapter three with the following questions:

*   What did Jessica know of the future when she decided to have a son?
*   Is it possible that Leto and the Baron could have been saved?
