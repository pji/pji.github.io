Dune Reread Notes
=================

With the release of the new *Dune* film and all the conversation around
it, I figured I'd try rereading it, with the following question in mind:

    What is *Dune* actually saying?

Yes, I know what people say it's about. And, I've heard the quotes from
Frank Herbert saying it's a warning about charismatic leaders. But, is
that what it's actually about, and does that warning actually work?
After all, I've also heard Herbert thank Richard Nixon for showing us
that we can't trust government. That was certainly... a take... at the
time. It's even more of one in the wake of the Reagan, Bush II, and
Trump administrations. 

These are my notes from the reread. I give no promises they are
intelligible to anyone other than me. These are just what I jot down
as I read, and the thoughts I have as I think back through the chapter.
I may go back through and try to clean them up a bit, but I also give
no promises on that.

I also give no promises what I get out of *Dune* is going to match what
anyone else is going to get out of *Dune.* I'm old and have opinions.

My third non-promise is that I'll finish this. Part of why this site
exists is that I wanted to play around with Github Pages. If you are
reading this, then my playing around has been successful. There is a
good chance I'll grow bored of doing a deep read of a novel I've read
twice before, and this will be abandoned. We'll see.
